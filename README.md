## **Summary of Assignment Requirements:**
**Datasets:** 
Applying classification techniques (Machine Learning) to solve a typical supervised machine learning problem - Machine status. This involves data preprocessing, training machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and presenting results clearly through code comments and visualizations.


**Machine Learning Workflow:**
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and feature scaling.

2. Model Development: Training multiple classification models using Scikit-learn.

3. Model Evaluation: Comparing model performance using confusion matrices and classification reports.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance through techniques like grid search or cross-validation.

## **PowerPoint Presentation:**
Include a cover page, a slide with dataset URLs, slides explaining each dataset, the analysis process, and insights gained. Students are required to present their findings to the lecturer.

**Outcome** 

Generated a model that has a 

1. **R-squared score of 0.8606**
2. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 135101.194**
